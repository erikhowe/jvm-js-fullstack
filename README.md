## Why Kotlin?
Why use Kotlin throughout the entire stack? There are benefits to doing this in both the backend and the frontend. In the backend, Kotlin runs on the JVM and compiles into bytecode which means that it has the same security, reliability and portability of Java while being much easier to write with. In the frontend, Kotlin/JS transpiles Kotlin into type-safe JavaScript. When both the front and backend are written in Kotlin, the application can share common code (i.e. data models or validation logic)
